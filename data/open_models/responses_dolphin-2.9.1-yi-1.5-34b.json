Dollar-Cost Averaging - This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money into a portfolio at regular intervals, regardless of the current market price. The rationale is that dollar-cost averaging can help mitigate the risk of market volatility by investing consistently over time, potentially leading to better long-term returns.\n\n4.
